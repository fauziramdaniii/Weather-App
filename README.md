# React + Vite Weather App

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- Clone The Repo https://github.com/fauziramdaniii/Weather-App.git
- Then Open Folder Project On Visual Studio Code or Another
- Open Terminal, Write Command `npm install`
- And Then Run The Weather App With Command `npm run dev`
